# XmlQuery

A utility for querying XML data using XPath queries.  I wrote this utility primarily because I wanted a quick way to test XPath queries before using them in code I am working on.

### Install

This is a simple .NET WinForms application.  You can just download the source and run it in Visual Studio.  I initially created this solution in Visual Studio 2010, but I last built it in Visual Studio 2013.  I think you can probably build it with the Express edition of Visual Studio, but I have not tested this.

### Usage

* Click the Load button to browse to an existing XML file.
* Type a valid XPath query into the query textbox.
* Hit Enter or click Query to run the XPath query.
* Use the Copy button to copy to clipboard or Save button to save to file.
